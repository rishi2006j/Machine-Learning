#  fNIRS Dataset for Parkinson’s Disease and Motor Task Analysis

This repository hosts resources and references for analyzing a functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) dataset collected from Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients and healthy controls during various motor tasks. The data enable exploration of cortical activity patterns associated with motor function and neurodegenerative disease progression.

##  Overview

This dataset provides **Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)** recordings from subjects with **Parkinson's Disease (PD)** and **age-matched healthy controls**. The recordings were collected while participants performed a series of motor tasks including:

-  Finger Tapping  
-  Walking  
-  Resting  

The aim is to examine **cortical activity in the motor cortex** during these tasks and to identify potential neurophysiological markers of motor impairment in PD.

##  Data Collection

fNIRS signals were captured using **high-resolution near-infrared systems** as subjects completed the motor tasks. Each participant's data is stored in a dedicated folder containing:

- **SNIRF files** – raw fNIRS signals for each motor task  
- **JSON metadata files** with:
  - Recording parameters  
  - Channel and optode configuration  
  - Coordinate system and spatial registration information

## 📈 Usage & Applications

This dataset is valuable for:

-  **Analyzing motor cortex activation** in Parkinson’s Disease  
-  **Investigating cortical variability** across subjects and task types  
-  **Identifying biomarkers** for disease progression and motor dysfunction  
-  **Validating neuroimaging pipelines** or fNIRS-based ML models
